**Notebook RAG Pro** is a professional-grade, high-performance Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) platform. It is engineered to transform static data—PDFs, CSVs, and plain text—into dynamic, interactive intelligence partners with unmatched surgical precision and zero-latency retrieval.

## 💎 The Philosophy: Ground Truth First
In a world of AI hallucinations, **Notebook RAG Pro** stands apart. This platform is built on a deterministic pipeline that ensures every response is anchored in reality. By utilizing a hybrid storage architecture, we ensure that if a fact isn't in your document, the AI won't invent it.

## ✨ Why Choose Notebook RAG Pro?
*   **SOTA Orchestration**: Leverages the power of **Meta Llama 3.1 70B** for human-level reasoning.
*   **Persistent Memory**: Integrated with **Qdrant Cloud**, ensuring your research stays indexed even after a server restart.
*   **Obsidian Aesthetic**: A premium, "Glassmorphism" environment designed for distraction-free, long-form research.
*   **Hybrid Vector Engine**: Seamlessly toggles between ultra-fast in-memory processing and scalable cloud storage.

## 🧠 Technical Deep Dive

### 1. Advanced Embedding & Retrieval
Using the **NVIDIA nv-embedqa-e5-v5** model, we map your documents into a **1024-dimension semantic space**. This allows the system to understand the *intent* behind your words, not just the keywords.
*   **Precision Grounding**: Enforces strict adherence to retrieved context via advanced prompt engineering.
*   **Cross-Format Support**: Seamlessly indexes complex PDFs, structured CSV data, and raw TXT files.

### 2. Scalable Cloud Infrastructure
Unlike basic RAG setups, this "Pro" version utilizes **Qdrant Cloud** for persistent document storage:
*   **Semantic Filtering**: Queries are filtered by `notebookId` within the cloud, ensuring your chat session remains private to that specific document.
*   **Recursive Chunking**: Smart text splitting (~900 chars) with semantic overlap (150 chars) to maintain context across boundaries.

### 3. Intelligence-First UI/UX
The interface is a tailor-made "Research Environment" designed for maximum productivity:
*   **Glassmorphism UI**: Translucent, blurred backgrounds and obsidian-charcoal tones for a premium feel.
*   **Real-Time Citations**: Streamed answers include automated `[N]` citations that link directly to the source.
*   **Source Evidence HUD**: Instantly inspect the exact paragraph the AI used to generate its answer with a dedicated "Source Preview" card.
